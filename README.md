# EcoHarmony Scanner

EcoHarmony Scanner is a computer vision project implemented with p5.js and ml5.js. This project leverages machine learning to detect and classify objects in a video stream, focusing on distinguishing between biodegradable and non-biodegradable items to promote environmental awareness.

## Features

- **Real-time Object Detection**: Utilizes the COCO-SSD model for real-time object detection in the video stream.
- **Biodegradability Classification**: Classifies detected objects as biodegradable or non-biodegradable based on predefined labels.
- **Educational Information**: Provides additional information on harmful effects or useful benefits for specific non-biodegradable and biodegradable items.
- **Visual Feedback**: Displays bounding boxes and labels around detected objects in different colors for easy identification.
